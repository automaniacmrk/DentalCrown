The crown material that you choose will be based on the type of teeth being capped and the aesthetic needs of your mouth.</p><p><a href="https://www.detaildental.com/crowns/">Ceramic Dental crowns</a> are crafted in a lab and built up layer by layer, sometimes with the help of CAD/CAM dental technology. This gives them the same slightly translucent appearance of natural teeth and makes them a popular choice for front teeth that will be on show. You can even create them chairside with a new technology that mills crowns in a matter of minutes. These are great because they can be completed in only one visit with no need for a provisional cap.</p><p>The downside of any ceramic material is that, although it is very strong, it is more brittle than metal and liable to crack or chip over time, but when fabricated correctly, they should be expected to last 15+ years. Some ceramic crowns, like Emax caps, are designed differently to be more durable.</p><p>Gold dental crowns and those made from other alloy metals tend to be much more durable. They have the added benefit of being biocompatible with teeth, which means the capped teeth shouldn't cause any damage or wear to the teeth they bite against. If the patient takes care of it, a gold crown will last for a long time.</p><p>Any metal crown has one major drawback: the color. Many people simply don't want a gold- or silver-colored tooth on show, even if it is tucked away at the back.</p><p>For others, having a gold tooth crown is quite appealing and they may go as far as to have it engraved or studded with gemstones!</p><p>Tooth cap prices can vary from one clinic to another, as with all dental treatments. It's worth shopping around and comparing prices between dentists near you, especially if you need to get more than one of your teeth crowned.</p><p>There is also more to consider than just the cost of a tooth cap; as discussed above, there are pros and cons to each type of crown. In addition to asking your dentist about dental crown costs, inquire about the different options that may be suitable for you. It is a good idea to inquire about the options available to you from your dentist if you find yourself in similar circumstances.</p><p>Full ceramic crowns, on the other hand, are more expensive than full metal ones. Because they require more work to look natural, front tooth crowns are more expensive.</p><p>Type of crown</p><p>Prices</p><p>Strenth/durability</p><p>Aesthetics</p><p>Other commments</p><p>Metal</p><p>$500 - $1,500</p><p>$800 - $2,000</p><p>$600 - $1,800</p><p>$700 - $2,000</p><p>Ceramic (porcelain)</p><p>Very long lasting; excellent</p><p>This is the least durable of all materials.
