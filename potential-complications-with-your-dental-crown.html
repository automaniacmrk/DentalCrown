Some possible complications include the following:</p><p>It is common to feel some pain after a crown is placed on a tooth. However, it is rare for you to experience severe or constant discomfort. If any pain or discomfort does not subside within a few hours, you should contact the dental office. The crown may have to be adjusted if the edges are causing irritation to your gums and adjacent teeth. If the tooth under the dental crown has severe, ongoing pain, it may have experienced trauma during the procedure and need attention.</p><p>Increased Sensitivity External stimuli cannot cause tooth irritation, so enamel protects the tooth's surface. Sensitivity to hot or cold liquids and foods can occur if the enamel thickness decreases.</p><p>Bite Issues: A dental crown changes the tooth's shape and size. Your bite may shift or become uncomfortable when it comes into contact with other teeth. You can adjust the crown to make it fit better with your other teeth.</p><p>If your dental crown is not taken care of properly, or you suffer from facial trauma, it may become cracked or damaged. The dental crown could also fall off if it becomes too large or the cement that holds it in place is damaged. If your crown falls or becomes damaged, contact your dentist right away.</p><h2>How Much Does a Tooth Crown Cost?</h2><p>Costhelper has estimated that the <a href="https://www.angelcaredental.com/service/dental-crown/">current price range for dental crowns</a> per tooth is:</p><ul><li>Gold crowns are available in a range of prices, from $600-$2,500</li><li>All-porcelain crowns can range between $800-$3,000</li><li>Porcelain-fused-to-metal crowns can cost $500-$1,500</li><li>Zirconia Crowns and E-max crowns cost approximately the same as all- porcelain crowns</li></ul><p>If you have insurance, about 50% of the crown can be covered. However, it all depends on what type of insurance you have and the facts of your case.</p><p>Your insurance will not pay for the cost of the crown if it is part of cosmetic treatments. If the procedure is preventative, such as to cover root canals or fix broken teeth, your insurance may be able to pay for the costs.</p></div><footer class="wrapper post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on August 23, 2022</p><div class="post__share"></div><div class="post__bio bio"><div class="bio__info"><h3 class="bio__name"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/DentalCrown/authors/dentist/" rel="author">Dentist</a></h3></div></div></footer></article><nav class="post__nav"><div class="post__nav-inner"><div class="post__nav-prev"><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/DentalCrown/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-prev"/></svg> <a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/DentalCrown/the-best-dentist-crown-material.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="prev"><span>Previous</span> The Best Dentist Crown Material</a></div><div class="post__nav-next"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/DentalCrown/dental-crown-treatment.html" class="post__nav-link" rel="next"><span>Next</span> Dental Crown Treatment </a><svg width="1.041em" height="0.416em" aria-hidden="true"><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/DentalCrown/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#arrow-next"/></svg></div></div></nav><div class="post__related related"><div class="wrapper"><h2 class="h5 related__title">You should also read:</h2><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T21:16" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/DentalCrown/dental-crown-treatment.html">Dental Crown Treatment</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T21:14" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/DentalCrown/the-best-dentist-crown-material.html">The Best Dentist Crown Material</a></h3></article><article class="related__item"><div class="feed__meta"><time datetime="2022-06-22T21:13" class="feed__date">June 22, 2022</time></div><h3 class="h1"><a href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/DentalCrown/why-do-you-need-a-dental-crown.html">Why Do You Need A Dental Crown?</a></h3></article></div></div></main><footer class="footer"><div class="footer__copyright"><p>Dental Crown</p></div><button onclick="backToTopFunction()" id="backToTop" class="footer__bttop" aria-label="Back to top" title="Back to top"><svg><use xlink:href="https://automaniacmrk.github.io/DentalCrown/assets/svg/svg-map.svg#toparrow"/></svg></button></footer></div><script>window.publiiThemeMenuConfig = {
